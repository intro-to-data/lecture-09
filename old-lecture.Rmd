## Motor Trend Car Road Tests

- **Description:** 1974 Motor Trend, 1973â€“74 cars
- **Format:** 32 observations on 11 variables
- Col 1	mpg: Miles/(US) gallon
- Col 2	cyl: Number of cylinders
- Col 3	disp: Displacement (cu.in.)
- Col 4	hp: Gross horsepower
- Col 5	drat: Rear axle ratio
- Col 6	wt: Weight (1000 lbs)
- Col 7	qsec: 1/4 mile time
- Col 8	vs: Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
- Col 9	am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- Col 10 gear: Number of forward gears
- Col 11 carb: Number of carburetors


## Weight as a function of Transmission

**Question:** 

- Is the average weight of a car varies by it's transmission type?
- Motorheads, hang on.

**Task:**

- Use R to calculate the average weight of cars, stratified by transmission 
  type. (use `group_by`, `summarize`, etc.)
- Use R to plot a box plot of car weight, grouped by transmission type.
  (use `ggplot`)

## Avg Weight

```{r}
ByTrans <- 
    mtcars %>% 
    group_by(am) %>%
    summarize(AvgWeight = round(mean(wt)*1000,2))
ByTrans
```

- The average difference in weight is 
  `r round(ByTrans$AvgWeight[ByTrans$am == 0] - ByTrans$AvgWeight[ByTrans$am == 1])`
- This is coded in an odd way. 0 == automatic.


## GGPLOT

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(am, wt, color=am)) + geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
mtcars %>% 
mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>% 
ggplot(aes(am, wt, color=am)) + geom_boxplot() 
```




## Do cars with different transmissions have different weights?

- Is average car weight different in automatics v manuals?
- Is average car weight a function of transmission?
- R Formula: `wt~am`

HINT: This are all saying the same basic thing!

## T-Test

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>%
    t.test(wt~am,data=.)
```

## T-Test 2

- The mean weights match what we did before.
- Now, look at the p-value.
- That is a very small number.
- P is less than .05, so we would commonly reject the null hypothesis that the
  average weight of automatic and manual transmission cars are the same.
- And this makes sense. If you are "into cars" you know that automatic 
  transmissions are much heavier than manuals.

## NHST

- What is Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)?
- What is the meaning of a p-value?

## Should we reject the null hypothesis?

Wikipedia: In statistical hypothesis testing, the p-value or probability 
value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the
results actually observed during the test, assuming that the null hypothesis 
is correct.

Translation: We have debased science to depend on something which is almost 
never true. Or even rationale.

## Another Example

**Question:**

- Do you think the average horsepower of a car differs because of the type 
  of transmission?

**Task:**

- Use R to calculate the average horsepower of cars, stratified by transmission 
  type.
- Use R to plot a box plot of car horsepower, grouped by transmission type.

## Avg Horses

```{r}
mtcars %>% group_by(am) %>% summarize(AvgHP = round(mean(hp),2),
                                      SdHP  = round(sd(hp)))
```

## GGPLOT

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(am, hp, color=am)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Your Turn

- YOU DO A `t.test()`
- `hp` as a function of `am`

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>% 
    t.test(hp~am, data = .)
```

- Not statistically significant.
- But the box plot suggests there's a pattern.

## T-Test Assumptions

- Normal means, not badly skewed
- sample mean and sample variance be independent . . . ha ha ha
- And you will hear that the central limit theorem sample means of moderately 
  large samples are often well-approximated by a normal distribution even if
  the data are not normally distributed
  - That last part really scares me.

## What Factors Affect A T-Test?

**Question:** What aspects of the data can affect the t-test results?

## What Factors Affect A T-Test?

**RESEARCHER DEGREES OF FREEDOM:**

- Sample Size
- Filtering
- Hidden Biases (in the data, researchers, etc.)

**IN THE DATA:**

- Sample Size
- Variance (this can also be a research degree of freedom)

## Let's Play

Take the last example:

- Only include engines with 250 hp or less
    - There are some obvious outliers.
- Calculate the avg hp, box plot, AND t-test.
- **Pro Tip:** You should copy/paste/edit what you did before.

## Avg Weight <= 250 hp

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    filter(hp <= 250) %>%
    group_by(am) %>% 
    summarize(AvgHP = round(mean(hp),2),
              SdHP  = round(sd(hp)))
```

## GGPLOT <= 250 hp

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    filter(hp <= 250) %>%
    mutate(am = case_when(am == 1~"Manual",TRUE~"Automatic")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(am, hp, color=am)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## T-Test <= 250 hp

```{r}
mtcars %>% filter(hp <= 250) %>% t.test(hp~am, data = .)
```

## Results

- Now we have a statistically significant difference.
- Those manuals cars w/ large hp are high performance cars.
- I think the filter is defensible, but it a researcher choice.

## Researcher Degrees Of Freedom

- How often have you read a paper that said they omitted outliers? Who? Why?
- How do you _really _know what factors could influence who does/does not get 
  into a study?
- Can you read a medical/psychology paper and ACTUALLY reproduce it?
    - Compare this to a chemistry or physics publication.
- Publishing the code only addresses one part of the problem.
- Even how we group things are subject to researcher degrees of freedom:
    - Gender (Male/Female?)
    - Race (Definitions aren't consistent for subjects either.)
    - Regional Differences (ADK v NYC v rural GA)

## Does weight vary by shape?

- By shape, I am talking about the arrangement of the cylinders.
- Some six-cylinders are straight (in-line) engines and some are v-shaped.
- So, we can only compare shape for six-cylinders.

```{r}
mtcars %>%
    filter(cyl == 6) %>%
    mutate(vs = case_when(vs == 0~"V-Shaped",TRUE~"Straight")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(vs, hp, color=vs)) + geom_boxplot()
```

So, just looking at this, there is clearly a lot of overlap.

## T-Test

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    filter(cyl == 6) %>%
    mutate(vs = case_when(vs == 0~"V-Shaped",TRUE~"Straight")) %>%
    t.test(hp~vs, data = .)
```

## But, what if our sample was larger?

- But we don't live in a world where we only have 96 rows of data.
- That's college-kid stuff.

```{r}

## Let's just get some more data.
BigCars <- bind_rows(mtcars,mtcars,mtcars,mtcars,mtcars,mtcars)

BigCars %>%
    filter(cyl == 6) %>%
    mutate(vs = case_when(vs == 0~"V-Shaped",TRUE~"Straight")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(vs, hp, color=vs)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## And . . . T-Test?

```{r}
BigCars %>% 
    filter(cyl == 6) %>%
    mutate(vs = case_when(vs == 0~"V-Shaped",TRUE~"Straight")) %>%
    t.test(hp~vs, data = .)
```

- The mean did not change. But now it is statistically significant.

## What does this mean????

- The more data you have, the more likely you are to find statistically significant results.
- What is _more_ important, the effect size.
- With enough data, most differences between groups will become statistically significant.
- That'
